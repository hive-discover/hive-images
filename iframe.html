For detailed information about data&nbsp;protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below this text.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Data acquisition on this website<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is responsible for data collection on this website?<br><br> The data processing on this website is carried out by the website&nbsp;operator. You can find the contact details of the website operator in the&nbsp;section "Information about the responsible authority" in this data&nbsp;protection declaration. &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How do we collect your data?<br><br> On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This can be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form. Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e. g. Internet browser, operating system or time of page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website. In addition, data is permanently collected and analysed by the HIVE Blockchain. More information is available here: <a href="https://hive.io/">https://hive.io/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What do we use your data for?<br><br> Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user behaviour or is required in the search and explore function. &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What rights do you have with regard to your data?<br><br> You have the right at any time to receive information free of charge about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have a right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You <br>also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. For this purpose, as well as for further questions about data protection,&nbsp; you can contact us at any time.<br><br><br> 2. Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; External Hosting<br><br> This website is hosted by three external service providers (hosters). The personal data collected on this website is stored on&nbsp;the&nbsp;hoster's servers. This may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contractual data, contact data, names, website accesses and other data generated via&nbsp;a website. The hoster is used for the purpose of fulfilling contracts with our potential and existing customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO) and in the interest of a secure, fast and efficient provision of our online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO). Our hoster will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfil its service obligations and follow our instructions regarding this <br>data. We use the following hosters: <br><br> GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr Street, CA 94107, San Francisco, USA<br><br> Contabo GmbH, Aschauer Straße 32a, 81549 Munich, Germany<br><br> Jsdelivr.com, more Information: <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net">https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net</a><br><br> <br><br> 3. General Information and required Information<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Data protection<br><br> The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially&nbsp;and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and <br>this privacy policy. When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what <br>we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done. We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e. g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete <br>protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the responsible authority<br><br> The responsible authority for the data processing on this website is: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christopher Kock<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Friedlandstraße 34<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;49744 Geeste<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Telephone: +49 (0) 160 93996561<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E-Mail:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hive-discover@outlook.com">hive-discover@outlook.com</a> <br><br> The responsible authority is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e. g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Storage duration<br><br> Unless a more specific storage duration has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally <br>permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e. g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the data transfer to the USA<br><br> Among other things, tools from companies based in the USA are integrated on our website. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective companies.&nbsp; We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject&nbsp;being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e. g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Revocation of your consent to data processing<br><br> Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Right to object to data collection and in special cases as well as to direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)<br><br> IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN<br> BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE&nbsp;21(1) DSGVO). IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH <br>MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).&nbsp; <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Right of appeal at the supervisory authority<br><br> In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Right of data portability<br><br> You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller,&nbsp; this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;SSL- or rather TLS-Encryption<br><br> This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Right to information, deletion and correction<br><br> Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions about personal data, you can contact us at any time.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Right of limiting the data processing<br><br> You have the right to request the limit of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to limit of processing exists in the following cases: If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the limit of the processing of your personal data. If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the limit of data processing instead of deletion. If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request limit of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure. If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your&nbsp;and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the limit of the processing of your personal data. If you have limited the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.<br><br> <br> 4. Data collection on this Website<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cookies<br><br> Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files and do not cause any damage to your terminal&nbsp;device.&nbsp;They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser. In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your terminal device when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These enable us or you to use certain services of the third-party company (e. g. cookies for processing payment services). Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e. g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behaviour or display advertising. Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions that you have requested (functional cookies, e. g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e. g. cookies to measure the web audience) are stored based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies has been requested, the storage of the cookies in question is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO); consent can be revoked at any time. You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited. Insofar as cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you separately about this within the framework of this data protection declaration and, if ecessary, request your consent.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Server-Log-Files<br><br> The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are: Browser type and browser version, operating system used, referrer URL, host name of the accessing computer, time of the server request, IP address. This data is not merged with other data sources. The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website -for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contact form<br><br> If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry form including the contact data you provided there will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this was requested. The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e. g. after we have completed processing your request). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Requests by E-Mail or Telephone<br><br> If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this was requested. The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e. g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular, statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;HIVE-Blockchain<br><br> We obtain most of our data from the HIVE blockchain. This is a public blockchain, which is not maintained by us. You can find more information here: <a href="https://hive.io">https://hive.io</a>. We have no influence on their content and are not responsible for it. Since some of the data stored on them are personal data, we usually process them only with your consent. However, the search function of our website cannot always wait for this consent, so it may be that your personal data has already been processed once before your consent. The basis for this is the public interest in the search function (Article 6 (1) (e) DSGVO). Of course, we give you the opportunity to object to this automatic data processing. If you wish to do so, please contact us by <br>e-mail or telephone.<br> <br> <br> 5.
